Dear Dad.

How are you? I am fine.

How is Switzerland? I have been reading Isaac Asimov's Robot Dreams. It is depressing, and really makes you think. 

I have a game called the Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I have defeated the Bugblatter Beast, but I am having trouble getting the Babel fish. 

When are you coming home? I miss you. 

Love,
Sunjay

P.S. Tomorrow I present my Gifted project on Atlantis.
