My credentials:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yale grad</li>
<li>writer for the New York Times, The Washington Post, and Wired</li>
<li>10 years teaching creative writing, including teaching at Columbia University</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a writing tutor, I don&rsquo;t just help students write essays; I also use that time as an opportunity to teach the underlying skills of logical reasoning, storytelling, and marshaling evidence in support of a thesis.

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Testimonials from my writing students:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;One of the top three creative writing classes I have ever taken&#x2014;and the other two were full semesters&rsquo; worth. I&rsquo;d definitely take any creative writing class or workshop by Jay. His class could easily turn into a TED talk.&rdquo; &#x2014;Rob Luciano</li>

<li>&ldquo;This class was very well-prepared, the presentation delivered with humor and insight. I enjoyed thinking about story (across genres) in a new way, and walked away with several revelations which apply to my writing life, as well as to life in general. Loved the conversational style.&rdquo; &#x2014;Jeanine Nicole</li>

<li>&ldquo;Jay&rsquo;s class is the perfect place to workshop an essay, short story, screenplay, or anything in between. You can&rsquo;t leave this class without learning at least one new thing about writing, regardless of your writing background. Jay pulls in lessons from movies, novels, and poems. I came out of Jay&rsquo;s class with a creative energy that is rare in my day-to-day. I highly recommend Jay&rsquo;s class for aspiring storytellers of all types!&rdquo; &#x2014;Erica Swallow</li>
</ul>

<p>
I help students conquer: 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>high school academic essays</li>
<li>papers for history, English, and literature</li>
<li>personal statements / college admissions essays</li>
<li>interview coaching and other help with packaging college applications</li>
</ul>

<p>
So many students out there have remarkable talents, but lack the writing ability to communicate them persuasively to an admissions committee. But those talents are wasted if the admissions committee sees only a sliver of who you are. Don&rsquo;t let a weak essay keep them from seeing the full scope of what you&rsquo;re capable of. Call today for a free consultation!
