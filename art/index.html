As 2016 lifts off and ascends toward its cruising altitude, I want to make sure you&rsquo;re all <span class="underline"><span class="underline">__</span></span> (fill in the blank, I need some suggestions). Consequently, I&rsquo;ve decide to gather some friends together for early cocktails this Friday.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ll be co-hosting this party with a friend, the brilliant Max Makewell, at his art studio in Gramercy. We&rsquo;ll be convening early, at 6:00pm, to toast the new year amid Max&rsquo;s spooky and mythic Rorschach-like paintings before disbanding at 10:00pm to forge off into the weekend as individuals once again. 
</p>

<p>
The house will offer light snacks and a festive menu of cold-weather cocktails to warm your seasonally-affected bones, including drinks of gin, mezcal, and moonshine. Your own civilian contributions of foodstuffs and booze are also welcome but by no means required. Do feel free too to invite friends.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to seeing you all.
</p>

<p>
Until then!
</p>

<p>
Jay
