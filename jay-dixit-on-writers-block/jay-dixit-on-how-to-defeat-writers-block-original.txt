I haven't sent you my draft article because I have major writer's block
I am struggling with what to write
** Jay Dixit
yeah? 
** Martine
even though there is so much to write about 
** Jay Dixit
you want to know my trick? 
for that?
** Martine
yeah
everytimeI have an idea I think it's bening
stupid
** Jay Dixit
OK here's my technique that I developed for my students. 
** Martine
ok?
** Jay Dixit
Here are the rules. 
1. Pick an amount of time. 20 minutes is good. 

2. You have to write for that whole time. Your pen can't stop moving. What you write doesn't have to be good, but you just have to keep the pen moving for the whole time. 
** Martine
ohhhhh
that's good
I like that!
** Jay Dixit
wait I haven't told it to you yet ☺ 
** Martine
oh...lol
** Jay Dixit
3. Don't write your blog post.
4. Instead, WRITE ABOUT WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT. 
5. Try to write down all of the questions and concerns you have. Write down everything you're thinking about, and then try to write down the solutions. 

So you might start by writing: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I have writer's block. This sucks. I have no idea what to write about. What should I write about? 

The problem is that the 2 or 3 ideas I have thought of are all stupid. 
OK so what are those ideas and why are they stupid. 
#+END_QUOTE

** Martine
ohhhhh!
** Jay Dixit
Well the first idea I had was to write about X. But I don't want to write about that because I feel like it's so cliche. 
** Martine
that's brilliant
** Jay Dixit
etc 
and keep writing questions and answers for the whole 20 minutes. 
** Martine
ohhhhhh
** Jay Dixit
And by the end you'll probably have a plan about what to write about. 
** Martine
nice, nice
I really like that! 
okay, let me try it
** Jay Dixit
It totally works!
** Martine
Because I would like to submit to you 2 articles within the next two weeks
** Jay Dixit
The trick is to not think anything without writing it down. 
** Martine
ohhhhhh
less pressure that way
** Jay Dixit
Like if you feel like an idea is stupid, you have to write that down. "But I don't like this idea. I feel like it's stupid. Here's why I think it's stupid." 
"Reasons reasons reasons. OK, so let's see, is there a way for me to write about this topic in a way that ISN'T stupid? I guess when I say stupid I mean cliched. So I guess the real question is, can I think of an original way to frame this topic? Well, one possibility would be to write about it from the perspective of....." 
etc 
** Martine
ahhhhhhhh
I think that's so great
** Jay Dixit
Writer's block is caused by having fears / feelings / judgments of what you're writing 
and so you don't write anything. 
** Martine
yup
** Jay Dixit
So just start writing, and write ABOUT the fears / feelings and judgments. 
** Martine
instead you just think and think and talk yourself out of writing
** Jay Dixit
And then once you've got them outof your system, then write about the solutions. 
Exactly.
** Martine
that's really brilliant
** Jay Dixit
Thanks ☺ 
** Martine
okay let me try that and I will check in a little later
thank you Jay!
** Jay Dixit
awesome! 
** Martine
that helps a lot
** Jay Dixit
and remember, it doesn't have to be "good" 
** Martine
how are you BTW?
** Jay Dixit
you're not trying to write something good 
you're just trying to get all your feelings out of your head and onto the page 
** Martine
okay that helps
it relieves the pressure
** Jay Dixit
yeah
** Martine
it's stream of consciousness
I LOVE THAT
** Jay Dixit
and if you don't know what to write, then ask yourself a question and then write down the answer. 
"How am I feeling about this project? Well, let's see..."
good luck!
