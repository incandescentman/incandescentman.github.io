* Jay Dixit 
* Conversation with Martine about Writer's Block


- I haven't sent you my draft article because I have major writer's block
- I am struggling with what to write

yeah? 

- even though there is so much to write about 

you want to know my trick? 
for that?

- yeah
- every time I have an idea I think it's stupid

OK here's my technique that I developed for my students. 

- ok?

Here are the rules. 

(1) Pick an amount of time. 20 minutes is good. 

(2) You have to write for that whole time. Your pen can't stop moving. What you write doesn't have to be good, but you just have to keep the pen moving for the whole time. 

- ohhhhh
- that's good
- I like that!

wait I haven't told it to you yet ðŸ™‚ 

- oh...lol

(3) Don't write your blog post.

(4) Instead, WRITE ABOUT WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT. 

(5) Try to write down all of the questions and concerns you have. Write down everything you're thinking about, and then try to write down the solutions. 

So you might start by writing: 

"I have writer's block. This sucks. I have no idea what to write about. What should I write about?" 

"The problem is that the 2 or 3 ideas I have thought of are all stupid. 
OK so what are those ideas? And why are they stupid?" 

- ohhhhh!

"Well the first idea I had was to write about X. But I don't want to write about that because I feel like it's so clichÃ©." 

- that's brilliant

etc 

and keep writing questions and answers for the whole 20 minutes. 

- ohhhhhh

And by the end you'll probably have a plan about what to write about. 

- nice, nice
- I really like that! 
- okay, let me try it

It totally works!

- Because I would like to submit to you 2 articles within the next two weeks

The trick is to not think anything without writing it down. 

- ohhhhhh
- less pressure that way

Like if you feel like an idea is stupid, you have to write that down. "But I don't like this idea. I feel like it's stupid. Here's why I think it's stupid." 

"Reasons reasons reasons. OK, so let's see, is there a way for me to write about this topic in a way that ISN'T stupid? I guess when I say stupid I mean clichÃ©d. So I guess the real question is, can I think of an original way to frame this topic? Well, one possibility would be to write about it from the perspective of X....." 

etc 

- ahhhhhhhh
- I think that's so great

Writer's block is caused by having fears / feelings / judgments of what you're writing. And so as a result of that fear and uncertainty, you don't write anything. 

- yup
- instead you just think and think and talk yourself out of writing

Exactly. 

So just start writing, and write ABOUT the fears / feelings and judgments themselves. 

And then once you've got them out of your system, then write about the solutions. 

- that's really brilliant

ðŸ™‚ 

- okay let me try that and I will check in a little later
- thank you Jay!

awesome! 

- that helps a lot

and remember, it doesn't have to be "good" 

- how are you BTW?

you're not trying to write something good 

you're just trying to get all your feelings out of your head and onto the page 

- okay that helps
- it relieves the pressure

yeah

- it's stream of consciousness
- I LOVE THAT

and if you don't know what to write, just ask yourself a question and then write down the answer. 

"How am I feeling about this project? Well, let's see..."

good luck!
