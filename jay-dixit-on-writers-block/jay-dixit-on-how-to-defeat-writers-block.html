<li>I haven&rsquo;t sent you my draft article because I have major writer&rsquo;s block</li>
<li>I am struggling with what to write</li>
<li>even though there is so much to write about</li>
</ul>

<p>
yeah? 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>yeah</li>
<li>every time I have an idea I think it&rsquo;s stupid</li>
</ul>

<p>
you want to know my trick? 
for that?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ok?</li>
</ul>

<p>
OK here&rsquo;s my technique that I developed for my students. 
</p>

<p>
Here are the rules. 
</p>

<p>
(1) Pick an amount of time. 20 minutes is good. 
</p>

<p>
(2) You have to write for that whole time. Your pen can&rsquo;t stop moving. What you write doesn&rsquo;t have to be good, but you just have to keep the pen moving for the whole time. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ohhhhh</li>
<li>that&rsquo;s good</li>
<li>I like that!</li>
</ul>

<p>
wait I haven&rsquo;t told it to you yet ðŸ™‚ 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>oh&#x2026;lol</li>
</ul>

<p>
(3) Don&rsquo;t write your blog post.
</p>

<p>
(4) Instead, WRITE ABOUT WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT. 
</p>

<p>
(5) Try to write down all of the questions and concerns you have. Write down everything you&rsquo;re thinking about, and then try to write down the solutions. 
</p>

<p>
So you might start by writing: 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have writer&rsquo;s block. This sucks. I have no idea what to write about. What should I write about?&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The problem is that the 2 or 3 ideas I have thought of are all stupid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;OK so what are those ideas? And why are they stupid?&rdquo; 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ohhhhh!</li>
</ul>

<p>
&ldquo;Well the first idea I had was to write about X. But I don&rsquo;t want to write about that because I feel like it&rsquo;s so clichÃ©.&rdquo; 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that&rsquo;s brilliant</li>
</ul>

<p>
etc 
</p>

<p>
and keep writing questions and answers for the whole 20 minutes. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ohhhhhh</li>
</ul>

<p>
And by the end you&rsquo;ll probably have a plan about what to write about. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>nice, nice</li>
<li>I really like that!</li>
<li>okay, let me try it</li>
</ul>

<p>
It totally works!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Because I would like to submit to you 2 articles within the next two weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>
The trick is to not think anything without writing it down. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ohhhhhh</li>
<li>less pressure that way</li>
</ul>

<p>
Like if you feel like an idea is stupid, you have to write that down. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like this idea. I feel like it&rsquo;s stupid. Here&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s stupid.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Reasons reasons reasons. OK, so let&rsquo;s see, is there a way for me to write about this topic in a way that ISN&rsquo;T stupid? I guess when I say stupid I mean clichÃ©d. So I guess the real question is, can I think of an original way to frame this topic? Well, one possibility would be to write about it from the perspective of X&#x2026;..&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
etc 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ahhhhhhhh</li>
<li>I think that&rsquo;s so great</li>
</ul>

<p>
Writer&rsquo;s block is caused by having fears / feelings / judgments of what you&rsquo;re writing. And so as a result of that fear and uncertainty, you don&rsquo;t write anything. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>yup</li>
<li>instead you just think and think and talk yourself out of writing</li>
</ul>

<p>
Exactly. 
</p>

<p>
So just start writing, and write ABOUT the fears / feelings and judgments themselves. 
</p>

<p>
And then once you&rsquo;ve got them out of your system, then write about the solutions. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that&rsquo;s really brilliant</li>
</ul>

<p>
ðŸ™‚ 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>okay let me try that and I will check in a little later</li>
<li>thank you Jay!</li>
</ul>

<p>
awesome! 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>that helps a lot</li>
</ul>

<p>
and remember, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>how are you BTW?</li>
</ul>

<p>
you&rsquo;re not trying to write something good 
</p>

<p>
you&rsquo;re just trying to get all your feelings out of your head and onto the page 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>okay that helps</li>
<li>it relieves the pressure</li>
</ul>

<p>
yeah
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>it&rsquo;s stream of consciousness</li>
<li>I LOVE THAT</li>
</ul>

<p>
and if you don&rsquo;t know what to write, just ask yourself a question and then write down the answer. 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How am I feeling about this project? Well, let&rsquo;s see&#x2026;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
good luck!
