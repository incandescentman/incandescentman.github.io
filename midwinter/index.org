* Midwinter Holiday Merriment
Friends,

As the days grow shorter and the grim shadow of winter envelops us in its icy embrace, let's gather together to defy the darkness.

Amidst the chill winds and long nights, we'll find solace in the warmth of mulled wine and classic cocktails. For my part, I'll be spending the day pre-making batches of the Snowdrift (a holiday cocktail of bourbon, cinnamon bitters, and homemade gingerbread syrup) and confecting my own favorite Canadian delicacy, [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nanaimo_bars][the Nanaimo Bar]].

Please join me this Friday at my home in Williamsburg. Together we'll raise our glasses to friendship, holiday cheer, and our triumph over winter's gloom.

[[mailto:jay@jaydixit.com][RSVP]] so I can get a headcount. Feel free to bring friends and loved ones. As always, your own civilian contributions of wine or spirits are welcome, or feel free to bring your own favorite holiday treats to share.

Hoping to see you there, \\
Sunjay
