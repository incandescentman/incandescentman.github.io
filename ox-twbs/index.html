                          I was born a gentleman, though I have been nothing but a
                          poor traveling trader and hunter all my life. Whether I have remained
                          so I know not, you must judge of that. Heaven knows I&rsquo;ve tried. I have
                          killed many men in my time, yet I have never slain wantonly or stained
                          my hand in innocent blood, but only in self-defence. The Almighty gave
                          us our lives, and I suppose He meant us to defend them, at least I have
                          always acted on that, and I hope it will not be brought up against me
                          when my clock strikes. There, there, it is a cruel and a wicked world,
                          and for a timid man I have been mixed up in a great deal of fighting. I
                          cannot tell the rights of it, but at any rate I have never stolen,
                          though once I cheated a Kafir out of a herd of cattle. But then he had
                          done me a dirty turn, and it has troubled me ever since into the
                          bargain.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                          Well, it is eighteen months or so ago since first I met Sir Henry
                          Curtis and Captain Good. It was in this way. I had been up elephant
                          hunting beyond Bamangwato, and had met with bad luck. Everything went
                          wrong that trip, and to top up with I got the fever badly. So soon as I
                          was well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold such ivory
                          as I had, together with my wagon and oxen, discharged my hunters, and
                          took the post-cart to the Cape. After spending a week in Cape Town,
                          finding that they overcharged me at the hotel, and having seen
                          everything there was to see, including the botanical gardens, which
                          seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country, and the new
                          Houses of Parliament, which I expect will do nothing of the sort, I
                          determined to go back to Natal by the <span class="underline">Dunkeld</span>, then lying at the
                          docks waiting for the <span class="underline">Edinburgh Castle</span> due in from England. I took my
                          berth and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal passengers from the
                          <span class="underline">Edinburgh Castle</span> transhipped, and we weighed and put to sea.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Among these passengers who came on board were two who excited my
                          curiosity. One, a gentleman of about thirty, was perhaps the
                          biggest-chested and longest-armed man I ever saw. He had yellow hair, a
                          thick yellow beard, clear-cut features, and large grey eyes set deep in
                          his head. I never saw a finer-looking man, and somehow he reminded me
                          of an ancient Dane. Not that I know much of ancient Danes, though I
                          knew a modern Dane who did me out of ten pounds; but I remember once
                          seeing a picture of some of those gentry, who, I take it, were a kind
                          of white Zulus. They were drinking out of big horns, and their long
                          hair hung down their backs. As I looked at my friend standing there by
                          the companion-ladder, I thought that if he only let his grow a little,
                          put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders, and took hold
                          of a battle-axe and a horn mug, he might have sat as a model for that
                          picture. And by the way it is a curious thing, and just shows how the
                          blood will out, I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis, for that
                          was the big man&rsquo;s name, is of Danish blood. He also reminded me
                          strongly of somebody else, but at the time I could not remember who it
                          was.
