* Midsummer Birthday Revelry
Friends,

As summer rains its searing stride down on our beleaguered city and the embers of distant wildfires blanket our skies in an apocalyptic haze, I warmly invite you to join me for an evening of belated birthday revelry this Friday, June 23 at 7:00pm.

Inspired by my recent writer's residency in Nova Scotia, I'll be serving a signature cocktail of my own creation called the Rainlight â€” a subtle blend of homemade pistachio-infused rum, chartreuse, and fresh lemon. As always, your civilian contributions of wine, spirits, and snacks are welcome and appreciated.

I'll be hosting the festivities at my brother's apartment in Park Slope, where I'm dogsitting Charley. There, amid the warm glow of happy memories and wagging tails, we'll revel in the joy of good company and raise a glass to friendship, adventure, and our beautiful burning world.

RSVP. Feel free to bring friends, but please let me know how many to expect.

Until then! \\
Jay
