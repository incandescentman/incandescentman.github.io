* *Midsummer Birthday Revelry*
Friends,

As summer rains down its searing stride and the embers of distant wildfires enshroud our skies in apocalyptic haze, I invite you to join me for an evening of birthday revelry this Friday, June 23 at 7:00pm.

Inspired by my recent writer's residency in Nova Scotia, I'll be serving a cocktail of my own creation called the Rainlight, a blend of homemade pistachio-infused rum, cr√®me de cassis, and fresh lemon. As always, your own civilian contributions of wine, spirits, and snacks are welcome and appreciated.

I'll be hosting the festivities at my brother's apartment in Park Slope, where I'm dogsitting Charley. There, we'll revel in the joy of good company and raise a glass to friendship, adventure, and our beautiful burning world.

[[mailto:jay@jaydixit.com][RSVP]]. Feel free to bring friends, but please let me know how many to expect.

Until then! \\
Jay
