	<h1>Let's change history.</h1>
<p>
I want to invite you a brainstorming and strategy session I&rsquo;m co-hosting on Tuesday at 5:30pm.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of the session is to gather a few smart and savvy people in the room to talk and brainstorm about a new tech platform being developed by two guys from Google, an engineer named David Quaid and a UX designer named Mike Leotta. 
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll be joined by Jay Dixit, a psychology/neuroscience writer who also teaches storytelling. 
</p>

<p>
Without revealing too much, the technology they&rsquo;re developing is designed to increase voter turnout. If it succeeds, it has the potential to sway elections and change the political landscape. 
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;d love to have you there. 
</p>

	  <p>Tuesday 5:30pm<BR>
<p>568 Broadway, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10012</p>
