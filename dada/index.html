Pujya Dada,
     Pranam.
</p>

<p>
I think I&rsquo;ve told you before that one of my very earliest memories is of a day when I was 6 years old, living in Amravati, and being very excited because Babuji had told us that Dada was coming and bringing a gift for us. On a clear sunny day, we gathered in a field and watched with excitement as you flew overhead and dropped a parcel from the plane! We ran to open the parcel and were so happy to find a box of chocolates you had wrapped for us. 
</p>

<p>
I also have many happy memories from my childhood of you coming to visit us, with your beard and your &ldquo;bush shirt.&rdquo; I remember in particular the time you brought me a model airplane kit made of balsa wood. 
</p>

<p>
I remember when I was in 9th grade, you lent me your camera so I could learn to take pictures. I also remember going with Chachaji to visit you in Bombay, in your flat up the hill in Andheri, and going sightseeing. And I remember my first time in the air, in a glider you&rsquo;d arranged for me to ride in from Safdarjung airport. Years later, when I was studying in Chicago, I have happy memories of visiting you in Montreal. 
</p>

<p>
I believe that when I was a young man I was quite contrarian, but over the years, I have learned to appreciate you and respect you more and more.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s to you, in appreciation of all the wisdom I&rsquo;ve learned from you over the years and all the happy memories we&rsquo;ve shared. 
</p>

<p>
Wishing you a very happy birthday. 
</p>

<p>
Madhu
