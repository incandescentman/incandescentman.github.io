* 2025-11-13 Thursday - Event Invitation Template Refactoring

** Session Overview
Refactored event invitation template to use org-mode macros for easy reuse

** Work Completed
*** Template Analysis
- Examined existing invitation template at invite-canonical/
- Reviewed index.org (org-mode source) and index.html (generated output)
- Analyzed parallax design, calendar integration, audio autoplay, and social metadata

*** Template Improvements Suggested
- Performance: lazy loading, image optimization, preconnect hints
- Accessibility: proper title tags, remove audio autoplay, color contrast fixes
- Mobile responsiveness: fix broken CSS that hides content below 750px
- Modern CSS: remove vendor prefixes, use CSS custom properties
- Security: HTTPS links, rel="noopener noreferrer" on external links
- Calendar integration: modernize from 2018 implementation

*** Macro Implementation
Converted hardcoded event details to reusable macros (lines 8-32 of index.org):
- Event titles and headings (5 parallax sections)
- Invitation text (greeting, body, closing, signature)
- Date/time (human-readable + ISO format for calendars)
- Location details (full address + short version)
- Map URL, RSVP email, audio file
- Calendar description and social media metadata

*** Additional Improvements
- Updated HTTP → HTTPS for external links
- Added rel="noopener noreferrer" to calendar links for security
- Removed audio autoplay initially, then restored per user request
- Cleaned up HTML structure with clear section comments
- Made template ready for easy event creation

** Files Modified
- /Users/jay/Dropbox/github/incandescentman/invite-canonical/index.org (complete rewrite with macros)

** Impact
Template is now fully parameterized. To create a new invitation, user only needs to edit the macro definitions at the top (lines 8-32). Everything else updates automatically through the `{{{macro-name}}}` syntax.

** Example Usage
New event invitation can be created by changing just these lines:
```org
#+MACRO: event-title Summer Soirée
#+MACRO: event-date Saturday, June 21, 8:00pm
#+MACRO: event-location 456 Broadway, Brooklyn NY 11211
#+MACRO: rsvp-email jay@jaydixit.com
# ... etc
```

All calendar links, headings, social metadata, and content automatically update.

** Testing Instructions
To test the template:
1. Export org to HTML in Emacs: Open index.org and run `C-c C-e h h`
2. View locally: `open invite-canonical/index.html`
3. Or run local server: `cd invite-canonical && python3 -m http.server 8000`
   Then visit: http://localhost:8000/index.html
