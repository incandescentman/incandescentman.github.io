<p>
Friends,
</p>

<p>
On Wednesday May 3rd, Neil will turn birthday for the birthdayth time, a solemn and austere occasion that calls for a most frivolous and profligate celebration.
</p>

<p>
The night will begin with a tasting of mezcal, a rare Mexican spirit with mysterious mystical qualities, to be followed in turn with conversation, carousing, and general merriment. So please join us on Wednesday in raising a glass to the thoughtful and generous man that is Neil Dixit.
</p>

<p>
Until then!
</p>

<p>
Jay

<p>
Spain maintained severe restrictions on the production of wine and spirits in Mexico almost to the end of its rule, with the consequences that most wine was imported, and most spirits were moonshine. The principal legal drink in Mexico, in terms of volume consumed, was pulque, the favorite moon juice of 2-Rabbits. It was still prepared in a more or less Aztec manner, still spoiled quickly, and its consumption was concentrated in towns. It had come to be perceived of as a type of food, in particular for pregnant women, who were exhorted always to drink at least two cups-one for themselves and one for the child inside them. Pulque was also provided to nursing infants, in the belief that it nourished and strengthened them. This new role had diminished its reputation as an intoxicant and it had become a beverage that anyone, of every age, might enjoy at any time.
</p>

<p>
Those Mexicans wishing to become their rabbits now drank mezcal, i.e., distilled pulque. This was the most common alcoholic beverage in mining communities, and also on the country&rsquo;s vast ranches and in the little villages that grew up to serve them. The rancheros produced mezcal for much the same reasons as Kentucky settlers made whiskey: Distillation concentrated their harvest, extended its life, and rendered it transportable. They took pride in their stills and competed in the quality of their product, to which they attributed medicinal as well as organoleptic properties. Mezcal was considered good &ldquo;for everything bad, and for everything good as well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The production of this panacea was concentrated in Jalisco, which had become an official part of independent Mexico in 1821. Jalisco was home to the first licensed mezcal distillery in the Americas, founded by Jose Antonio Cuervo, who had received permission from the Spanish crown to distill &ldquo;mezcal wine&rdquo; in 1795. Its products, and those of the multitude of other stills that sprang up postindependence, were drunk principally by men, who were expected to comport themselves with courtesy and dignity when under the influence. Mezcal was used for ceremonial as well as recreational purposes. The Mexicans had kept many of their pre-Columbian festivals alive in the guise of Christian fiestas, the most important of which were Los Dias de Muertos (the days of the dead) staged under the cover of the Catholic festivals of All Souls and All Saints. The dead were assumed to return to the world of the living for the duration of Los Dias de Muertos and were supplied with offerings of food and drink. Spirits were the most popular libations. and their tendency to evaporate when left out in a glass was interpreted as proof that the departed had taken a sip.

<h2 id="lorem-ipsum-dolor-2"><a id="org68ce6f1"></a>The natives and their intoxicants</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-lorem-ipsum-dolor-2">
<p>
Inspired, perhaps, by the cocktails he had tested in the East, Sir Richard Burton paid the keenest attention to the alcoholic and other stimulants he came across while en route. He tasted whatever the staging posts had to offer and also gathered data on native intoxicants. He was fascinated, for instance, by the potential of a &ldquo;kind of cactus called by the whites &lsquo;whiskey-root&rsquo; and by the Indian &lsquo;peioke,&rsquo;&rdquo; which was said to act on the system just like whiskey, &ldquo;only its effects are what I might term a little k-a-v-o-r-t-i-n-g, giving rather a wilder scope to the imagination and actions. &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In consequence the population of Salt Lake City was, as far as Burton could judge, in a constant state of sobriety and health. Indeed, he was impressed by the general level of well-being, in particular among the British saints who formed a majority of immigrants at the time: &ldquo;Children and adults have come from England apparently in a dying state, and have lived to be strong and robust men.&rdquo; He attributed their vitality to both the altitude and temperance: &ldquo;The atmosphere is too fine and dry to require or even to permit the free use of spirituous liquors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After refreshing himself in the pure mountain air of Salt Lake City and taking a last liquor up&ldquo; with his traveling companions, Sir Richard Burton exited the United States via San Francisco. He paused on his voyage home in Mexico, where, even after eight months on the road through a nation in the making, he was shocked by the chaos and took &rdquo;philosophical consolation in various experiments touching the influence of Mezcal brandy, the Mexican National drink, upon the human mind and body.&ldquo; The tumult of Mexico, exaggerated by mezcal, sweetened Burton&rsquo;s perception of America, and in particular the last portion of its soil that he had touched. San Francisco, true to Richard Henry Dana&rsquo;s prophecy, had become a considerable place, thanks to the gold rush.
