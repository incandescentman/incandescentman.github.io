* Impromptu Wine and Cheese Summer Soirée 🍷🧀💌
Friends,

In advance of my departure for Rome, I'm putting together an impromptu wine and cheese soirée tonight at 8:00pm.

For the evening's central offering, I've chosen a Grüner Veltliner---a captivating, dry white wine hailing from Austria. A selection of red wines will also be available, each chosen to harmonize with a variety of cheeses. As for a cocktail, classic Negronis will be served, offering a balance to both wine and cheese.

Please feel free to extend the invitation to friends and loved ones, and feel free to bring contributory wines or cheese of your own.

Let's raise a glass to the end of summer!

Until then! \\
