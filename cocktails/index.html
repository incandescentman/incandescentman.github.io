Since it seems that everyone has their own plans for later in the evening, I&rsquo;ll be having people over for early cocktails on Saint Marks so we can all be together as a family one last time before 2015 takes its final bow. 
</p>

<p>
Nota bene, this is not a New Year&rsquo;s party but a pre-New-Years pre-party. We&rsquo;ll be gathering at the unfashionably early hour of 5:00pm to toast the year ahead before adjourning promptly at 8:00 and scattering across the boroughs. 
</p>

<p>
The house will offer a limited menu of cocktails of gin, mezcal, and moonshine. Your own civilian contributions of spirits and snacks are welcome but by no means required. Friends are also welcome.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to seeing you all. 
</p>

<p>
Until then!
</p>

<p>
Jay
