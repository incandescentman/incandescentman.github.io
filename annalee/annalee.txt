I was at dinner earlier with my friend Andy from improv

this other woman from our class was there too 

and this woman is an alcoholic. always gets really messy and then gets mean

at dinner she was being super uncool attacking Andy, so I told her she was being uncool and to stop. and she did 

she just sent me a long apology 

over text 

what's a good way to respond but not engage?

- Not every text needs a response. I'd ask what's your motive for responding?

well she's being vulnerable in reaching out and apologizing. so I'd feel heartless not responding at all 

like it was heartfelt 

- Yeah. Unless you want to pursue a friendship or otherwise, I don't think a response is necessary. Sounds to me like bait to engage. Or you could write something simple. 10 words or less. "Thanks. I'm no longer interested in being in touch. All the best." And if she doesn't leave you alone block her. I wouldn't engage with an alcoholic at all. I've learned that the hard way. 
- Or "I forgive you. Thanks for the message. All the best."

oh that's perfect

and "I forgive you" doesn't sound high-and-mighty, like I think I'm better than her? 

(as opposed to "that's OK"?)

- Yeah. And if I was making a true amends that's all I would want. Tho I would let go of the outcome. If she continues with anything after that to me it would be an indicator that it wasn't sincere & she's even less healthy

OK this is helpful 

I'm sending the second one you suggested 

seeing her in improv classes may be unavoidable, but from now on I won't go to evening events if she's going to be there 

- I could offer some other insight about the situation and your part if you're interested? If not no worries.

yes please 

- Just from where I sit, for me, it's best for me not to tell people what to do. If someone's engaging in behavior I don't like I try to just remove myself from the situation. Crusading on someone else's behalf is an impure motive for me. It usually means I'm trying to teach someone a lesson or control another person's behavior. Maybe she will just go away. I find that if someone is engaging in unhealthy behavior and then I engage in unhealthy behavior we are then somehow connected & it often leads to confusion. Water seeks its own level. Hopefully this will be the end of it. If this doesn't resonate with you, no worries. I could be wrong.

yes, I agree
