Here is an HTML file called "progress.html" for my project, "100 Days of Writing." The HTML file is automatically generated from my Emacs org-mode data file "progress.org", which is where I keep track of my daily writing habit.

Write a script.js Javascript file to dynamically parse the HTML:

- use Tailwind.CSS
- display 8 columns. 7 columns for the days, and the 8th column for the name of the month
- display the days in a series of rows, with 7 days per row
- parse the date of the last (7th) day of the row and detect what month it is in
- display the name of the month in the 8th column
- days should appear in the order in which they appear in the HTML file. do not add any days
- the first 7 days that appear in this particular HTML file are: 2024-05-27 Mon, 2024-05-28 Tue, 2024-05-29 Wed, 2024-05-30 Thu, 2024-05-31 Friday, 2024-06-01 Sat, and 2024-06-02 Sun. These 7 should all appear in a row, then the 8th column should display the month name. Then the next group of 7 days should appear in the following row, and so on. 7 days per row, plus the month name in the 8th column.
- I cannot change the structure of the HTML. The HTML file is generated automatically from progress.org. However, I can change or add things to progress.org.
