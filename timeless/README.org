** Summary:
- A web-based, infinitely scrolling calendar that lets you add notes to any day. New weeks generate dynamically as you scroll, expanding endlessly in both directions. 🔄📖
- All data is stored client-side using ~localStorage~, ensuring complete privacy. 🔐📝
- To add a note, just click a day and start typing. Pressing Enter saves it; deleting the text removes it. ✍️🚀
- The current date is always highlighted, and the calendar auto-scrolls to today upon loading. A calendar button lets you return to today instantly. 📍🎯
- Month names and years appear in the blank space after each month, making navigation intuitive even when scrolling far ahead or back. 🗓️🔍
- Export and import calendar data via JSON files, making backups simple. 💾📂
- Sync across devices by saving your calendar data to a shared drive (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive).
   + The sync button compares timestamps, ensuring newer data is preserved. 🔄🌐

This project is an appreciative fork of [[https://madebyevan.com/calendar/][Continuous Calendar]] by Evan Wallace, with additional functionality I've added.

* Why
** The Problem: Conceptualizing the future one month at a time
Traditional digital calendars like MacOS Calendar and Google Calendar segment time into discrete months: You conceptualize the future one month at a time. 🏗️🧩

[[file:_img/typical-interface.png]]

You're shown a single month's worth of dates. Then, to navigate through time, you click the ~＞~ or ~Next~ button... at which point the current month is replaced by a view of the next month. 🔄📖

[[file:_img/nextmonth.png]]

Having different months displayed as discrete units in this way doesn't make sense for my brain. It presents time as discontinuous and divided, making it difficult to conceptualize in an intuitive way when events are happening relative to each other. 🧠⚡

With traditional calendars, I find it difficult to plan ahead as I think about the future as I figure out, say, travel dates for an upcoming trip. ✈️🗺️

Even calendars that offer the ability to display several months at once still separate dates from one month to the next:

[[file:_img/mc-simple.png]]

Your brain has to do a little mental calculation to grasp that the 31st of one month down at the bottom over here is just one day before the 1st of the next month up there on the right. 🔍🎭

It's not like your brain can't figure it out... but it requires a level of abstraction, intellectualizing the concept of time. 🤯📐

It's like a map that's not to scale. Sure, you can mentally compensate... but wouldn't you rather just be able to see at a glance where things are, knowing you can trust your intuitive sense of how far away things are from each other? 🗺️🎢

** The Solution: A continuous perspective
[[file:_img/unreliablenarrator_infinite_future_with_scrolling_calendar_dat_aab1ab6f-609f-41ad-b18c-af1556b51b19.png]]

What I want is a calendar that accurately depicts the continuous flow of time, displaying the future as what it is: a continuous series of days. 🌊🕰️

Instead of having to click "Next," like turning the page of a book, I want to be able to just scroll down to see upcoming events. 📜🎡

Why are calendars designed in this counterintuitive way? Tradition. In the old days, we hung paper calendars on the wall. Wall space, since it's physical space, is limited. Your wall isn't high enough -- and you're not tall enough -- to display 12 months worth of days. 🏛️📅

But we're not in the 12th century anymore (the name of this app notwithstanding). Google Calendar is not a wall calendar. Just as an e-reader lets you scroll continuously instead of flipping pages, why shouldn't a calendar work the same way? 📖🔄

I figured others might feel the same way, so I looked for solutions.

** A Continuous Calendar
Then I stumbled upon [[https://madebyevan.com/calendar/][Continuous Calendar]] by [[https://github.com/evanw][Evan Wallace]]. It was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for: a calendar where I could scroll down and up as I thought about the future and planned my weeks and months. One that displayed time in a visual, intuitive way. 🌊🗓️

I built on Evan's work with several key upgrades:
- Added the option to display days of the week. 🗓️📊
- Added month names for easier navigation. 🌍📆
- Implemented backup/export functionality using JSON. 🔄💾
- Wrote a Python script to convert saved data into an ICS file for import into MacOS Calendar. (Still a work in progress.) 🐍📅
- *European-style week layout:* Weeks start on *Monday,* because weekends belong together. When I plan *this weekend*, I'm thinking of both Saturday and Sunday, not splitting them up. 📅🇪🇺

I'm *not* a coder. ChatGPT Plus made these changes for me. Here's my conversation with it:

** 🎉 New Functional Enhancements

** 🔄 Smoother Undo
Undoing changes used to require a *full page reload.* Now:
- Undo restores the last saved snapshot *in place*, keeping navigation uninterrupted.
- The calendar re-renders using ~loadCalendarAroundDate(todayDate)~, so your scroll position stays put.
- The result? *Faster, smoother undo.* 🏎️🔙

** ✨ Highlight "Clicked" Day
To confirm when you've added a note:
- The clicked day *briefly* flashes with a highlight effect (~.clicked-day~ class).
- The highlight disappears after 500ms, letting you know it worked. 🎆🔍

** 📝 Smarter Multi-Line Input
Now you can write longer notes *without friction*:
- *Enter* (no Shift) saves and closes.
- *Shift+Enter* adds a new line for bullet points or longer thoughts.
- Quick notes stay quick. Longer notes stay readable. ✏️📜

** 📅 Improved Date Picker
The "Jump to Date" field now has a practical range:
~<input type="date" id="jumpDate" min="2000-01-01" max="2050-12-31">~
- Keeps navigation user-friendly while allowing customization. 🎯📌


** Expanded Mini-Calendar Overview

- *Multi-Month Display:* The mini-calendar now shows the previous, current, and next months in a vertically stacked layout.

- *Smooth Animations & Transitions:*
 - Calendar cells now have refined hover effects with a slight scale-up and deeper shadow.
 - A subtle ripple effect provides immediate feedback when a cell is clicked.
 - The overall scrolling animations have been smoothed out for a more polished experience.
- *Glassmorphism for Notes:* Note textareas now use a semi-transparent background with a blur filter to create a modern frosted-glass look.
- *Animated Dot Grid Background:* The dot grid background has a slow, subtle movement to add depth without distraction.

** Undo/Redo Functionality

- *Undo Support:* Use Ctrl+Z (or plain "z") to undo the last change.
- *Redo Support:* Use Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y to redo the last undone change.
- *Enhanced Editing Control:* These features offer better control during extensive note editing and calendar updates.

** Additional Enhancements
- *Mouse & Keyboard Harmony:* Both mouse interactions and keyboard shortcuts work together seamlessly for adding, editing, and navigating calendar entries.

* Visual & UI Enhancements
In this release, Timeless not only remains a continuous calendar but also becomes a feast for the eyes and smoother to interact with. The following upgrades have been implemented:

** Modern Pastel Palette & Refined Typography
- *Fresh Color Scheme:* The CSS variables have been updated to use a modern pastel/duotone palette for a soft, elegant look.
- *Typography Upgrade:* Month headings now use *Playfair Display* for a bold, sophisticated appearance, while day numbers are styled with *Fira Code* to create a clear, monospaced contrast.

** Smooth Hover & Focus Effects
- *Custom Transitions:* Buttons and day cells now use custom cubic-bezier transitions, resulting in fluid, natural animations.
- *Soft Glow on Hover:* A subtle glow effect (using the accent color) is applied when hovering over day cells, enhancing interactivity.

** Refined Ripple Animation
- *Enhanced Feedback:* The ripple effect on cell clicks has been refined with a longer duration and smoother fade-out, providing immediate and polished visual feedback.

** Layout & Structural Tweaks
- *Parallax Overlay:* A semi-transparent overlay with a blend mode has been added to the parallax background for a "liquid" look that deepens the visual experience.
- *Sticky Header Dynamics:* The header now starts transparent and transitions to a solid background with a drop shadow when scrolling beyond 50 pixels, ensuring it stays legible and prominent.

** Expanded Header with Increased Whitespace
- *Larger Header:* The top month and year header has been enlarged, featuring a bigger font size and extra vertical padding.
- *Improved Readability:* Additional whitespace above and below the header creates a more spacious, visually appealing layout that immediately draws attention to the current period.

* New enhancements
What You've Enhanced & Suggestions for Further Improvements
 1. New Color & Semantic Palette:
- You've defined a set of semantic colors (primary, secondary, success, info, warning, danger) and then tied your core variables (e.g. --bg-primary, --accent) to them. This makes the theme more intentional and flexible.
- Suggestion: You might consider standardizing names (e.g. using either "accent" or "color-primary" consistently) to avoid redundancy.
 2. Custom Scrollbar Styling:
- The new scrollbar rules give a subtle, modern look.
- Suggestion: Test in various browsers to ensure the effect works well on non-WebKit browsers.
 3. Enhanced Mini-Calendar:
- Your new mini-calendar styling adds extra padding, a frosted (blurred) background, rounded corners, and a soft box-shadow---making it visually distinct and modern.
- Suggestion: If you want to revert these changes (see next section), you can restore the original minimal styling.
 4. Sticky Header Improvements:
- Increasing the opacity (from 80% to 95%) and using a solid background for the sticky header greatly improves legibility.
- The larger font and extra vertical padding for the month heading also add clarity and elegance.
 5. Dynamic Animations & Effects:
- You've refined the hover effects for calendar cells (with perspective transforms, subtle shadows, and a "shine" effect on month boundaries).
- The updated "today" pulse animation with custom keyframes makes the current day stand out without being overwhelming.
 6. Enhanced Help Overlay:
- The help overlay now has increased dimensions, extra padding, rounded corners, and a backdrop blur---making it easier to read and more visually appealing.
 7. Additional UI Touches:
- Animated button icons and a refined loading spinner contribute to a modern, polished feel.
- Adding tag detection (processing hashtags in notes) is a clever usability and visual enhancement.
 8. Keyboard Navigation Mode:
- The new keyboard navigation mode---toggled via the "i" key, with "q" (or Escape) to exit---provides a clear, dedicated mode for day-by-day navigation.
- The visual indication (via a body outline) and toast messages make the mode change clear to users.

Below is an example README section describing the new "Download Org-Mode Events" feature, along with an update to the help information:

Download Org-Mode Events

The new Download Org-Mode Events feature allows you to quickly export your upcoming events in a format that is compatible with Emacs Org-mode. When you click the download button, the calendar will scan for events starting from today through the next month and generate a plain text file named timeless-calendar-events.org. The export will include only those dates that have entries, and each date is formatted in the standard Org-mode timestamp style.

Note: Dates with no events are omitted from the export.

Additionally, when you download the events the output is automatically copied to the MacOS clipboard for easy pasting into your Org-mode files.

How It Works
 - Button: A new button with a download icon (an SVG icon is provided) is added to the header.
 - Function: Clicking the button triggers the downloadOrgEvents() function, which gathers the event data, formats it according to the Org-mode structure described above, and then:
 - Saves the output to a file named timeless-calendar-events.org.
 - Copies the output text to your MacOS clipboard.

By including this functionality, you can easily integrate your calendar events into your Org-mode workflow for better planning and task management.
