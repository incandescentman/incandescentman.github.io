** Summary:
- A web-based, infinitely scrolling calendar that lets you add notes to any day. New weeks generate dynamically as you scroll, expanding endlessly in both directions. 🔄📖
- All data is stored client-side using ~localStorage~, ensuring complete privacy. 🔐📝
- To add a note, just click a day and start typing. Pressing Enter saves it; deleting the text removes it. ✍️🚀
- The current date is always highlighted, and the calendar auto-scrolls to today upon loading. A calendar button lets you return to today instantly. 📍🎯
- Month names and years appear in the blank space after each month, making navigation intuitive even when scrolling far ahead or back. 🗓️🔍
- Export and import calendar data via JSON files, making backups simple. 💾📂
- Sync across devices by saving your calendar data to a shared drive (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive).
   + The sync button compares timestamps, ensuring newer data is preserved. 🔄🌐

This project is an appreciative fork of [[https://madebyevan.com/calendar/][Continuous Calendar]] by Evan Wallace, with additional functionality I've added.

* Why
** The Problem: Conceptualizing the future one month at a time
Traditional digital calendars like MacOS Calendar and Google Calendar segment time into discrete months: You conceptualize the future one month at a time. 🏗️🧩

[[file:_img/typical-interface.png]]

You're shown a single month's worth of dates. Then, to navigate through time, you click the ~＞~ or ~Next~ button... at which point the current month is replaced by a view of the next month. 🔄📖

[[file:_img/nextmonth.png]]

Having different months displayed as discrete units in this way doesn't make sense for my brain. It presents time as discontinuous and divided, making it difficult to conceptualize in an intuitive way when events are happening relative to each other. 🧠⚡

With traditional calendars, I find it difficult to plan ahead as I think about the future as I figure out, say, travel dates for an upcoming trip. ✈️🗺️

Even calendars that offer the ability to display several months at once still separate dates from one month to the next:

[[file:_img/mc-simple.png]]

Your brain has to do a little mental calculation to grasp that the 31st of one month down at the bottom over here is just one day before the 1st of the next month up there on the right. 🔍🎭

It's not like your brain can't figure it out... but it requires a level of abstraction, intellectualizing the concept of time. 🤯📐

It's like a map that's not to scale. Sure, you can mentally compensate... but wouldn't you rather just be able to see at a glance where things are, knowing you can trust your intuitive sense of how far away things are from each other? 🗺️🎢

** The Solution: A continuous perspective
[[file:_img/unreliablenarrator_infinite_future_with_scrolling_calendar_dat_aab1ab6f-609f-41ad-b18c-af1556b51b19.png]]

What I want is a calendar that accurately depicts the continuous flow of time, displaying the future as what it is: a continuous series of days. 🌊🕰️

Instead of having to click "Next," like turning the page of a book, I want to be able to just scroll down to see upcoming events. 📜🎡

Why are calendars designed in this counterintuitive way? Tradition. In the old days, we hung paper calendars on the wall. Wall space, since it's physical space, is limited. Your wall isn't high enough -- and you're not tall enough -- to display 12 months worth of days. 🏛️📅

But we're not in the 12th century anymore (the name of this app notwithstanding). Google Calendar is not a wall calendar. Just as an e-reader lets you scroll continuously instead of flipping pages, why shouldn't a calendar work the same way? 📖🔄

I figured others might feel the same way, so I looked for solutions.

** A Continuous Calendar
Then I stumbled upon [[https://madebyevan.com/calendar/][Continuous Calendar]] by [[https://github.com/evanw][Evan Wallace]]. It was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for: a calendar where I could scroll down and up as I thought about the future and planned my weeks and months. One that displayed time in a visual, intuitive way. 🌊🗓️

* My Enhancements
#+CAPTION: The *Timeless* interface, now with even more fluidity.

I built on Evan's work with several key upgrades:
- Added the option to display days of the week. 🗓️📊
- Added month names for easier navigation. 🌍📆
- Implemented backup/export functionality using JSON. 🔄💾
- Wrote a Python script to convert saved data into an ICS file for import into MacOS Calendar. (Still a work in progress.) 🐍📅
- *European-style week layout:* Weeks start on *Monday,* because weekends belong together. When I plan *this weekend*, I'm thinking of both Saturday and Sunday, not splitting them up. 📅🇪🇺

I'm *not* a coder. ChatGPT Plus made these changes for me. Here's my conversation with it:

** 🎉 New Functional Enhancements

** 🔄 Smoother Undo
Undoing changes used to require a *full page reload.* Now:
- Undo restores the last saved snapshot *in place*, keeping navigation uninterrupted.
- The calendar re-renders using ~loadCalendarAroundDate(todayDate)~, so your scroll position stays put.
- The result? *Faster, smoother undo.* 🏎️🔙

** ✨ Highlight "Clicked" Day
To confirm when you've added a note:
- The clicked day *briefly* flashes with a highlight effect (~.clicked-day~ class).
- The highlight disappears after 500ms, letting you know it worked. 🎆🔍

** 📝 Smarter Multi-Line Input
Now you can write longer notes *without friction*:
- *Enter* (no Shift) saves and closes.
- *Shift+Enter* adds a new line for bullet points or longer thoughts.
- Quick notes stay quick. Longer notes stay readable. ✏️📜

** 📅 Improved Date Picker
The "Jump to Date" field now has a practical range:
~<input type="date" id="jumpDate" min="2000-01-01" max="2050-12-31">~
- Keeps navigation user-friendly while allowing customization. 🎯📌


** Expanded Mini-Calendar Overview

- *Multi-Month Display:* The mini-calendar now shows the previous, current, and next months in a vertically stacked layout.
- *Clear Month Headers:* Each mini-calendar section includes a header indicating the month and year.
- *Quick Navigation:* Clicking on any day in these mini-calendars instantly navigates you to that date in the main calendar.

** Enhanced Keyboard Navigation

- *Arrow Key Precision:* Left and right arrow keys now move day by day---crossing week boundaries seamlessly without skipping any dates.
- *Enter Key for New Entries:* Pressing Enter on the currently highlighted day creates a new note.
- *Delete Key Functionality:* Pressing Delete while a day is highlighted deletes all entries for that day (with a confirmation prompt), making it easy to manage entries using just the keyboard.
- *Escape Key in Textareas:* When editing a note, pressing Escape cancels the editing session (by blurring the field).

** Improved Mouse Interaction

- *Single-Click Entry Creation:* Clicking on any empty space within a day cell creates a new note.
- *Single-Click to Edit:* Clicking on an existing note focuses the textarea for editing.
- *Restored Classic Behavior:* These changes restore the familiar mouse-based interactions alongside the new keyboard shortcuts.

** Refined Visual and UI Effects

- *Timeless Button Redesign:* The "Timeless" button has been updated with a modern gradient, increased padding, rounded corners, and smooth hover/active effects.
- *Smooth Animations & Transitions:*
 - Calendar cells now have refined hover effects with a slight scale-up and deeper shadow.
 - A subtle ripple effect provides immediate feedback when a cell is clicked.
 - The overall scrolling animations have been smoothed out for a more polished experience.
- *Glassmorphism for Notes:* Note textareas now use a semi-transparent background with a blur filter to create a modern frosted-glass look.
- *Animated Dot Grid Background:* The dot grid background has a slow, subtle movement to add depth without distraction.

** Undo/Redo Functionality

- *Undo Support:* Use Ctrl+Z (or plain "z") to undo the last change.
- *Redo Support:* Use Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y to redo the last undone change.
- *Enhanced Editing Control:* These features offer better control during extensive note editing and calendar updates.

** Additional Enhancements

- *Mouse & Keyboard Harmony:* Both mouse interactions and keyboard shortcuts work together seamlessly for adding, editing, and navigating calendar entries.
- *Infinite Scroll & Responsive Design:* The calendar supports infinite scrolling and adapts smoothly across different devices.
