#+TITLE: Timeless
#+STARTUP: overview

* Introduction
Welcome to *Timeless*, an infinitely scrolling calendar designed to help you visualize time continuously as you plan your life.

Here it is in action:
[[https://incandescentman.github.io/timeless/][Timeless: The Infinitely Scrolling Calendar ðŸ“…âœ¨]]

This project is an appreciative fork of [[https://madebyevan.com/calendar/][Continuous Calendar]] by Evan Wallace with some added functionality of my own.

* Why
** The Problem: Conceptualizing the future one month at a time
Traditional digital calendars like MacOS Calendar and Google Calendar segment time into discrete months: You conceptualize the future one month at a time.

[[file:typical-interface.png]]

You're shown a single month's worth of dates. Then, to navigate through time, you click the ~ï¼ž~ or ~Next~ button... at which point the current month is replaced by a view of the next month.

[[file:nextmonth.png]]

Having different months displayed as discrete units in this way doesn't make sense for my brain. It presents time as discontinuous and divided, making it difficult to conceptualize in an intuitive way when events are happening relative to each other.

With traditional calendars, I find it difficult to plan ahead as I think about the future as I figure out, say, travel dates for an upcoming trip.

Even calendars that offer the ability to display several months at once still separate dates from one month to the next:

[[file:mc-simple.png]]

Your brain has to do a little mental calculation to grasp that the 31st of one month down at the bottom over here is just one day before the 1st of the next month up there on the right.

It's not like your brain can't figure it out... but it requires a level of abstraction, intellectualizing the concept of time.

It's like a map that's not to scale. Sure, you can mentally compensate... but wouldn't you rather just be able to see at a glance where things are, knowing you can trust your intuitive sense of how far away things are from each other?

** The Solution: A continuous perspective
[[file:unreliablenarrator_infinite_future_with_scrolling_calendar_dat_aab1ab6f-609f-41ad-b18c-af1556b51b19.png]]

What I want is a calendar that accurately depicts the continuous flow of time, displaying the future as what it is: a continuous series of days.

Instead of having to click "Next," like turning the page of a book, I want to be able to just scroll down to see upcoming events.

Why are calendars designed in this counterintuitive way? Tradition. In the old days, we hung paper calendars on the wall. Wall space, since it's physical space, is limited. Your wall isn't high enough -- and you're not tall enough -- to display 12 months worth of days.

But we're not in the 12th century anymore (the name of this app notwithstanding). Google Calendar is not a paper calendar. Just as your iPad lets you read a book in "Continuous Scroll" mode rather than requiring you to manually turn the page every few paragraphs, you can just press the down arrow to read on.

That's the experience I want for a calendar and I bet I'm not the only one.

To try to solve this problem, I researched and bought various apps that sounded promising, including [[https://www.moleskine.com/en-us/shop/moleskine-smart/apps-and-services/timepage/][Timepage by Moleskine]] and [[https://agenda.com/][Agenda]]. Though interesting approaches, they didn't offer the visually intuitive monthly interface I was looking for.

** A Continuous Calendar
Then I stumbled upon [[https://madebyevan.com/calendar/][Continuous Calendar]] by [[https://github.com/evanw][Evan Wallace]]. It was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for: a calendar where I could scroll down and up as I thought about the future and planned my weeks and months. One that displayed time in a visual, intuitive way.

* Evan's Original Features
- Infinite scrolling through months and years, both forward in time (i.e. downward on the scrolling calendar) and backward in time (i.e. upward).
- Click on a day to add calendar events.
- Calendar data stored not on the cloud but within your browser's local storage.

* My Enhancements

I've taken Evan's original implementation and added a few enhancements of my own:
- Added the ability to display days of the week
- Added the ability to display name of month
- Add the ability to save a backup of your stored calendar events as a JSON file; and add the ability to load stored events from said backup file.
- Added an accompanying Python script to take the saved data and convert it into an ICS file that I can import into my MacOS calendar. (This doesn't yet work reliably.)
- European-style calendar: In my mind, the week begins on Monday. Why? Because, for the reasons discussed above, it doesn't make sense to separate Saturday and Sunday into separate weeks. I think of the weekend as a single unit. When I ask myself what I'm going to do this weekend, I'm thinking about Saturday and Sunday, not Saturday of this week and Sunday of next.

I'm not a coder. ChatGPT Plus made these changes for me. Here's a record of my conversation with ChatGPT:

** What remains to be done:
- In order to facilitate exporting calendar data to a calendar app like MacOS calendar, I want to modify the format of saved data to explicitly store the full date of each calendar event.
