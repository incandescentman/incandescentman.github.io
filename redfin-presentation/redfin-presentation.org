*** *Goal 1:* Apply analytical thinking to the proposal planning process :slide:
- Learn to use and apply the question method, a
 technique for identifying the structure and major points of a
 document by asking and answering a series of analytical questions
- Use the question method to articulate the purpose
 of the document
- Use the question method to define the key points
 for each section
- Use the question method to formulate a logical
 structure

*** *Goal 2:* Write with the reader in mind :slide:
- Write with clarity and precision
- Trim for concision

You'll be rewriting the document you brought

you're coming with a draft of what you're working on. we'll start from scratch, start from the very beginning so we can not only improve the current proposal, but so we can know how to start proposals from scratch in the future. you might feel like you already did this, but the point of this isn't just to perfect what you already did, but to teach you a new way of approaching this in the future.


** *Criteria for success:* What makes a proposal good? :slide:
1. *Rigorous*. You've asked and answered the right questions.
2. *Organized*. Structured so as to make it easy to follow the logic behind it.
3. *Clear*. Written in a direct way such that it's easy for the reviewer to understand.
4. *Concise*. Doesn't ramble or repeat. Gets to the point quickly. No extraneous information.
5. *Data-driven*. Provides data demonstrating why the plan is expected to succeed.

Write out the structure
use the headings to create an outline of this document so that we can look at the structure from a high level

They can get the idea of this, start grappling with it

5 minutes, get as far as you can

Then I'll reveal the answer:

Get them to create this:

use the headings that are already there

Look at the document, describe the flow of information

When I step back from it, and I try to answer these questions:

- What's the flow of information?
- What is this document intended to do?
- What does each section represent?

It's unclear.

Glancing at this structure, it's hard to tell what conclusion is being argued for and what points are being made in support of that conclusion. Here's my revised structure.

I don't even know if it's a proposal for a strategy to do, or if it's a summary of how the company is structured?

It's hard for me to see from these headings what the flow of the document is

Listen in on what they say, then relay the correct ones to the whole group
or do redirection if necessary


In the revised version above, I make the logic explicit in the headings, enabling executives to (1) see and understand the argument at a glance, and (2) always know what point is being made in each section.

So you can see that when the structure is strong, it's easy to say what the flow is because
- structure: each heading is logical and builds on what came before
- the features that make the structure explicit: the headings are labeled explicitly. So it's easy to navigate

Descriptive headings are a tool to make the structure explicit



** How do bad documents happen?        :slide:
*** Notes                                :notes:

Why is it that we sometimes write a document that's not as well thought out as it could be?

It's not because we don't know what we're doing, we don't know the answers, we don't have the insights.

It's not because we're unable to logically think through a strategy. The problem is that a lot of us are not in the habit, mentally, of breaking down our thinking process into discrete steps.

For those of us who aren't naturally analytical thinkers, organizing and writing a document is hard because we don't know where to start.

** Writing with the reader in mind
*** Notes                                :notes:
The biggest mistake novice writers make is to write without the reader in mind. Novice writers write while mentally asking questions based on their own needs, questions like, "What do I know? What's all the information I can put in?"

But clear writing requires empathy for the reader.

# I'll talk about a psychology concept called "the curse of knowledge"---the tendency of writers to unwittingly assume that the reader already knows everything they themselves know.

you must keep the reader's needs in mind at all times, asking questions like, "What does the reader *already* know? What does the reader need to know to understand the point I'm making? What evidence is likely to convince a skeptical reader that this is going to work?"

** How *not* to write a document :slide:
1. The brain dump
2. The curse of knowledge
3. Trying to strategize in your head

** *Mistake #1:* The Brain Dump          :slide:
*** Notes                                :notes:
What do we do? We sit down and start writing down their thoughts, without organizing first and without any thought about what the reader actually needs to know.

Their thought process might look something like this: "OK, where do I start? Introduction. What should I say in my introduction? I'll need to make three points, what three points can I make?" And so on.

The result is a brain dump, a rambling and disorganized document that's poorly organized, hard to follow, and often riddled with logical holes and unanswered questions.

We just write down what we know and keep going until we can't think of anything else to say.

*** the fridge metaphor
All the ingredients in your mind

Doing that is kind of like trying to bake a cake by opening your refrigerator, taking out all the food you have in your fridge, beer, mustard, leftover pizza, garlic, chocolate, and putting it in a big bowl. Most of those ingredients aren't necessary! And in fact they'll get in the way. The key to baking a cake is what you leave out!

*** the purpose of the document isn't to communicate what you know
It's to tell the reader what they need to know.


** *Mistake #2:* The curse of knowledge  :slide:

*** Notes                                :notes:
- what the curse of knowledge is
- knocking thing
- Emma Thompson

So what you have to do is ask yourself at every moment, what does the reader know, what does the reader not know?
- What different terms mean
- when you assume the reader already knows, unconsciously
- obviously you *do* have to guess what the reader knows and don't knows. But make those determinations consciously, not automatically

** *Mistake #3:* Trying to strategize in your head :slide:

*** Notes                                :notes:
Trying to write the finished product directly
Trying to write down only the words that will appear in the final draft.

e.g. you write "introduction" and then you try to write the first sentence... and then the second sentence and then the third sentence.

Driving in the fog. No! Draw a map!

The main mistake people make is they sit down and try to write the finished product.

It comes out however it comes out.

Mistake: just write down what you know, what you can think of to write. I have all this information, let me just write it down.

Write down a heading?

If you only write down the final product... And doing all the planning, structuring, organizing in your head. Then it's hard to think about what does the reader know, need to know... and when... and how to explain things the best way

wrong.

** right way: be strategic! Think about the reader!

** Outlining isn't enough    :slide:
** Outlining isn't enough    :slide:
How do you know what to put in the outline?

*** Notes                                :notes:

Otherwise it's the same problem again. You're trying to write the final draft of the outline in the first go. It's not going to work.

Then you're just passing the same problem down the chain. How do you figure out what to put in your outline?

Before you start outlining, you need to know what the structure *should* be.

You need to plan the structure, weigh options

Before you outline, you need to know what you're trying to say

You need to *think* even before you outline!

Outline strategically!

Reverse outlining. Asking a question.

When you're outlining, you're still kind of in the mode of listing

Yes, you're ordering things, rearranging them...

But you need to dig even deeper than that. You need to be thinking strategically about what to put in or not put in, *how* to present information to the reader

It means you're trying to do all that thinking in your head

** *Thinking* is the *first* step to clear writing :slide:
- The main problem with business writing is a lack of clarity
- Writing is thinking on paper
- Clear thinking → clear writing

*** Notes                                :notes:
- If the writing is sloppy, the thinking is sloppy too
- clear writing requires clear thinking
- *writing is thinking on paper*
- it's a lack of clarity not only in the sentences, but in the thinking itself
- I teach a method for clear thinking

** How to think analytically :slide:
Analytical thinking is the process of asking and answering questions.

*** Notes                                :notes:
How do you think clearly, analytically, strategically?


Thinking is just asking and answering questions
- do the whole Tony robbins thing

Analytical thinking is the process of asking and answering questions.

If I can figure out what questions to ask, I find I often already know the answers.

*Analytical thinking is really just the process of asking and answering questions*. If you can ask the right questions and then answer them, that means you have a logical argument.


** How to write clearly :slide:
*asking good questions → good answers → clear thinking → clear writing*

** A technique for thinking clearly :slide:
*** Notes                                :notes:

Is what I'll teach you here today

** First step: Create two separate documents :slide:
1. Your *thinking* file
2. The document you'll present to the reader
*** Notes                                :notes:
1. Your *thinking* file. You figuring out for yourself what to put in and how to communicate it, ordering. This isn't even a draft. This is strategy. your notes to yourself
2. The document you'll present to the reader. First draft, second draft.

** The NYWI method           :slide:
1. Think
2. Outline
3. Write
4. Rewrite (for clarity)
5. Trim (for concision)

** The NYWI method      :slide:
1. Think strategically and analytically using the *question method*
   - Ask the right questions
   - Answer those questions
2. Outline
3. Write
4. Rewrite (for clarity)
5. Trim (for concision)

** How do you know what the right questions are? :slide:

** The question method        :slide:

*** Notes                                :notes:
The question method is a tool I developed to prompt employees to ask and answer the right questions. The goal is to give you a step-by-step process for thinking analytically.

Analytical thinking is the process of asking and answering questions.

** The question method    :slide:
1. Start by writing: "What question is this document trying to answer?"
2. Whenever you know the answer to a question, write down the answer.
3. If you /don't/ know the answer, think what other question you'd need to answer to get there. Write down that new question.
4. As new questions arise, write those down too.
5. Go to #2.
6. Continue asking and answering questions until all questions are answered and you can't think of any more relevant questions.

*** Notes        :notes:
The question method is a tool I developed to prompt employees to ask and answer the right questions. The goal is to give you a step-by-step process for thinking analytically.

By the end of the process, you'll have a comprehensive list of questions and answers you can draw on in writing your document.

See how you don't even get to an answer until you really drill down into the questions

To figure out what the important questions are

        - Yes, we think it might.
          - *Why do we think it might? What data do we have?*
          - We think this approach might increase our market share because our consumer research is telling us that sellers are price conscious and want to save as much money as possible on the sale. So, we have a hypothesis that maybe if we cut our commission to 1%, which is 33% to 50% off the standard commission that other agents charge, we might increase our market share.

        - *OK, so will the plan succeed in increasing our market share?*
        - Yes, we think it might.
          - *Why do we think it might? What data do we have?*
          - We think this approach might increase our market share because our consumer research is telling us that sellers are price conscious and want to save as much money as possible on the sale. So, we have a hypothesis that maybe if we cut our commission to 1%, which is 33% to 50% off the standard commission that other agents charge, we might increase our market share.
            - *OK, and have we tested this hypothesis?*

*** Notes                             :notes:
For writing to be clear, the reader must not only understand the information, but must also why each piece of information is *relevant to the broader argument*. To put it another way: A proposal document should make a series of points, not just provide background information.

The reader has to know why they need to know this

**** relocation example---relevance
For example, the "About the Relocation Customer" section is confusing because it's not clear how the information is relevant. Take this part:

: "Relocatees have three traits that make them different from people moving within the same city... (1) They don't know where to move in their new city."

What point is being made here? The reader will read this and think, "OK, and...? OK, so relocating customers don't know where to move in their new city. So what? What about it?"

But instead of going on to provide a "so what" and explain why this information is significant, the document goes on to list other factoids about relocating customers.

It seems like the information in the "About the Relocation customer" section is merely background for what is to come later. But if you want the reader to register information, it should be provided only at the point where it's relevant, not before.

To me, the place where the information above is actually relevant is later, in the section recommending that Redfin begin offering Neighborhood Consultations. In that part of the document, it does make sense to point out that relocating customers don't know where to move in their new city. In this context, the information actually is relevant because it's a statement about a problem with the current way of doing things---a problem to which Neighborhood Consultations are the solution.

*** and it should be a question the reader has
Not just a random question they don't care about like "what are some facts about relocating customers?"

The reader does not have the question
- OK what are some fun facts about relocation customers

What the reader's question actually is is:
- OK what's your plan again
- and what's the strategy for implementing it?
- and what's the evidence that it's going to work?
- and what's the problem again with the way we're doing it now?

*Adjust Agent Events, Roles, and Education*

*Deal Writing Agents:*  Agents report that relocatees tour homes inefficiently at the start of their search because they have not yet narrowed their neighborhood focus. We recommend creating a new event called a “Neighborhood Consultation” that would delight customers, reduce customer search time and increase  tour-to-close conversion. We think the event will, at minimum increase conversion from an estimated 30% to 32%, generating ~200 more closes per year and increasing revenue by $2M.

If a section of the document is recommending that a particular action be taken, it's clearer if the heading itself is phrased as a recommendation. Generally, using verbs is clearer and more forceful than listing nouns.

Take the heading *Deal Writing Agents*. This section is actually making an important recommendation: that Redfin should begin offering Neighborhood Consultations. But this is not apparent from the heading. I changed the heading to *Begin offering Neighborhood Consultations* to make it more clear what point is being made.

*Begin offering "Neighborhood Consultations"*

One thing that makes relocating customers different is that they don't know what neighborhood to move to in their new city. Indeed, agents report that relocatees tour homes inefficiently at the start of their search because they have not yet narrowed their neighborhood focus.

We recommend creating a new event called a "Neighborhood Consultation," which would delight customers, reduce customer search time, and increase tour-to-close conversion. We think the event will, at minimum increase conversion from an estimated 30% to 32%, generating ~200 more closes per year and increasing revenue by $2M.

*Adjust Agent Events, Roles, and Education*

*Support Agents and Relocation Coordinators*
Support Agents rarely book both a tour and listing consult for the same customer. This is an incentive-related problem that applies broadly, but it is a particularly acute issue with reloc ating customers. This is both because relocatees are unfamiliar with their destination city and because Support Agents don't know DWAs or booking protocols outside their market.

We recommend creating a HUB-based Relocation Coordinator (RC) role. The RC will be an expert in booking all event types for any Redfin market and will be familiar with our relocation-specific resources, such as Opportunity Score and neighborhood pages. Support Agents and Tour Coordinators will route relocation calls to the RC who could set up the appropriate events in both regions. At first, this might be a part time position for 3-4 Support Agents. Alternatively, if the proposed Redfin VIP program is implemented, the role could be handled by a VIP Agent. The VIP program has also specified an algorithm-based tool which would allow a VIP Agent or RC to find and schedule the right agent in any market. We strongly support the development of this tool.

*** Notes        :notes:
Likewise, the heading "Support Agents and Relocation Coordinators" is also hiding an important recommendation: that Redfin should add the role of Relocation Coordinator. I changed the heading to *Add a Relocation Coordinator role*. This is a key recommendation of the document, and it should be labeled clearly so the reader knows what's in the section and where it fits into the larger argument.

** Demo: How to title your headings  :slide:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*Add a "Relocation Coordinator" role*
Support Agents rarely book both a tour and listing consult for the same customer. This is an incentive-related problem that applies broadly, but it is a particularly acute issue with relocating customers. This is both because relocatees are unfamiliar with their destination city and because Support Agents don't know DWAs or booking protocols outside their market.

We recommend creating a HUB-based Relocation Coordinator role. The Relocation Coordinator will be an expert in booking all event types for any Redfin market and will be familiar with our relocation-specific resources, such as Opportunity Score and neighborhood pages. Support Agents and Tour Coordinators will route relocation calls to the Relocation Coordinator, who will then set up the appropriate events in both regions.

Through July 2016 we have spent $4.5M on digital media, up 134% YoY and +24% compared to our original 2016 budget. We project the cohort from January through July will drive $17.1M in revenue, up +162% YoY over the same period last year.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We've also developed standardized templates for every campaign we run. This has allowed us to automate how we publish our Redfin listings on Google and Facebook and how we launch campaigns in new markets. This cut another six hours per week of manual time and let us update our listing advertisements daily instead of weekly. We could even update them every hour in busy listing seasons! Investing in automation is critical so we can invest more in media and less in headcount as we grow.

*Reach in-market home-buyers and sellers for the least money*: We're dependent on Google and Facebook for our overall performance. 67.4% of 2016 paid contacts come from those sites. By the end of 2017, we'll add additional ad networks like Criteo or Yahoo and at least 50% of contacts will come from other sites. This goal is dependent on scaling search on Bing and proving out display ads.

Topic sentence must be specific still, not vague, confusing, ambiguous, imprecise

** Use precise language
Expand Advertising on Mobile: Mobile traffic represents 61% of total site traffic. However, none of our Redfin listing campaigns on Facebook, and only 14% of paid search ads outside of Seattle, are on mobile. By the end of 2017, we'll have launched all campaigns in all markets on mobile devices. To get there, we'll need support from search, apps, and customer growth to improve conversion on our mobile web and apps in 2017 so we can bid more aggressively on mobile. We may never get mobile conversion to the same level as desktop, but every bit helps.

As the great writing teacher William Zinsser said, the essence of writing is rewriting. The reality is that revising and editing makes the difference between writing that's clear, tight, and concise vs. writing that's meandering.

In this section I teach employees how to go back after they've written a draft and read it with fresh eyes; how to compare a document to the original outline and look for holes; how to trim the fat and leave only what's needed; tricks like printing out a hardcopy and using a different colored pen; and how to "switch modes" from creator to critic so you can look for vague, confusing, or insufficiently supported passages and address them.

** Examples and non-examples           :slide:

  Update, and Direct Marketing: How Big Can It Get?)

** transferable strategies
*** tricks for concision
- print it out and use a red pen

*** switch modes
From writer to editor

*** edit with fresh eyes
imagine it's someone else and leave mean comments for yourself
"What the hell are you trying to say here?"

 - does this add any meaning?
 - or does this mean exactly the same thing without these extra words

Trimming is easy, it's just a matter of remembering to do that as an additional step at the end.

What did you notice yourself trimming most often. Get to know yourself as a writer, you add adverbs to things, you have some prepositional phrases

The objective isn't to notice these things so that you never need to trim in the future. The objective is to add trimming to your checklist of things to do. It's necessary step. You always need to trim.

Do I assume the reader has any prior knowledge of Redfin's business? Many board members serve on seven or eight boards, and appreciate our assuming they know or remember very little. It is hard to be concise, and still to explain Redfin as if to a newcomer, but that is our challenge. Do I use acronyms or jargon?

how do you know?
By always asking yourself: do they know this? Do they need to know this? For each thing.

** concision
Defining what question each section is asking is also very helpful for keeping the plan concise. Ask yourself: What information should you include in a section? Answer: Only the information necessary to answer the question the section is asking.

** Writing Clear Sentences
This is the unit on actually writing sentences. How to write clear sentences; how to avoid major mistakes; and advice for writing strong and forceful sentences (use declaratory sentences with strong verbs, give examples, be specific and concrete). This unit can be longer or shorter depending on people's skill level. Ideally it would be based on workshopping passages from employees' actual proposal documesentences to work on problem areas.
