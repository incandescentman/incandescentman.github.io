	hey my brother is thinking about buying an apartment in Brooklyn Fort Greene I told him he should talk to you and access your brilliant business brain 



- oh yes! He should! 
- 😇😇😇 




	awesome 

	thanks!! 



- Your first referral!! Caribbean cruise here we come! Is he set onFt Green?





	no

	but he definitely wants to live in Brooklyn

	and he likes Fort Greene

	but is open — within Brooklyn



- Oh cool, is it more investment or he just doesn't wanna blow moneyon rent anymore?





	investment

	he'd be selling his place in Toronto to buy in Brooklyn

	plus also the rent thing and he'd live there



- If he wants to make money he needs to go to Bed-Stuy or something. let's chat. We have a Development here but I don't know if he's want to live that far. Tons have sold tho 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ yeah let's chat





	that's literally exactly what I told him but he doesn't want to live in Bed Stuy

	cool cool thank you

	get some rest, good luck tomorrow



- Yeah or if he wants investment sunnyside queens 
-	So basically it's just a savings plan with the hopes of appreciation beyond inflation





	right. so it's combo investment + where he'd want to live



- It's DEF a buyers market so he'd make money 
-	For sure! I understand





	appreciation beyond what he'd be making in Toronto

	but you said it's not the best time to buy —at least in Manhattan

	right?



- Cool cool! If he can hang on to it for a bit there might be someoops around the l train shutdown. But yeah let me think on it and circle back. I could ask around





	he can hang on

	yup



- Under $1.25 in Manhattan is fine. Just can't sell for at least 5years 
-	Over that price point with taxes doesn't make sense





	I see



- In BK it's really already built up in the hotspots 




	that's what I told him

	that Fort Greene is already expensive



- Not a lot of money left to make but I don't know the Toronto market 
-	Yeah 





	yeah. OK we'll talk



- I don't know the L train shutdown neighborhoods but I'll also ask more BK people too





	cool

	Fort Greene is unaffected

	Williamsburg is the main one affected. but L train shutdown is temporary so I'm not sure how much it affects prices for purchasing



- YeH I could see prices dipping in the short run & negotiatingpower...and appreciating back after the constructions done if he can Uber. 👌 night!! 





	cool cool

	thank you



- Yeah I don't know... it has to be strategic in BK since not a lot of money to be made 





	right



- But paying rent is a loss always so 




	right



- Kk 




	good thoughts



- We'll dfg it out! 




	awesome
