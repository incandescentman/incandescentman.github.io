I spoke to a group of students at Simon Fraser University. They asked about how to use ChatGPT to support them in writing policy briefs without having it generate the article for them.

That&rsquo;s really helpful.

<p>
Sunjay, I have a question that kind of links this. A lot of the writing we&rsquo;re doing is not creative. It&rsquo;s not really fulfilling our own goals.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s for a professor, or it&rsquo;s for&#x2026; So, we&rsquo;re writing policy briefs in this context. And I wonder if you can give us some ideas of the prompts we could generate to think about how to improve the writing for the audience.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;re thinking about the difference with the creative writing process and how you get feedback.
</p>

<p>
But what happens when you&rsquo;re writing not in a creative context? When you&rsquo;re writing with stricter boundaries, what are the kinds of prompts you might use with ChatGPT with that kind of writing?
</p>

<p>
Because we&rsquo;re trying to foster our own voice. But most of the students here don&rsquo;t get to write in their own voice very often, unless it&rsquo;s for their personal use.

Give me an example of a writing assignment and what it might be that&rsquo;s the kind of non-creative writing assignment that you might have.

So yeah, so the assignment that we&rsquo;re working on now is really to create a policy brief. To try and convince a public audience first of all — but also try and convince a certain policy maker — everyone has a different audience — of how and why to reallocate a particular form of militarized spending.
</p>

<p>
So whether it&rsquo;s F-35s, or money spent on the carceral system — and reallocate that to the issue they&rsquo;ve been focusing on.
</p>

<p>
So whether that&rsquo;s more nurses, or support for those with opioid addictions..
</p>

<p>
So everyone has a different issue they&rsquo;ve been focusing on. Human security and enhanced human security, and we&rsquo;re thinking of ways to reallocate militarized spending.
</p>

<p>
So they&rsquo;re writing a policy brief, and then we&rsquo;re going to write a social media post that&rsquo;s a little bit more concise, because in the end, we&rsquo;re trying to both influence policymakers, but also reach a public audience to say, &ldquo;hey you can Think about military spending differently.&rdquo;

<p>
Yeah, exactly.
</p>

<p>
I might start by sitting stating my goal like that, right, and see what it says. it&rsquo;s so already, it&rsquo;s giving me an outline for balancing credibility and clarity with moral force and emotional resonance.
</p>

<p>
So this is what I would call, it&rsquo;s helping me clarify my goals.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;OK, great. You want to convince them. One. Maybe you can do it by doing this I outlined for in spending on military, yeah, and it&rsquo;s giving me an outline that I can use for the thing itself.&rdquo;
<img src="policy-brief/SCR-20250623-mwgy.png" alt="SCR-20250623-mwgy.png">
So at this point I might say like, &ldquo;no, no stop. Do not write the opening paragraph. Please do not do any writing for me. I want all the ideas and the writing to come from me instead. Help me clarify I what the piece? What attributes the piece would need to have in order to can convince policy.&rdquo;
<img src="policy-brief/SCR-20250623-mwjq.png" alt="SCR-20250623-mwjq.png">
So you can see, the default thing that ChatGPT might want to do is to jump in and do it for you. I have to clarify and tell it &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, here&rsquo;s what I want instead.&rdquo;
<img src="policy-brief/SCR-20250623-mwkq.png" alt="SCR-20250623-mwkq.png">

OK, maybe this is helpful&#x2026; &ldquo;to influence policymakers and engage the public, your piece should have five core attributes, credibility. Need to trust your facts, anticipate counter arguments and feel that you&rsquo;re serious. So by citing authoritative sources using precise numbers and comparisons, preempting objections.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So, that&rsquo;s a good one. You never want the reader to feel like they&rsquo;re smarter than you, and to read something that you wrote and be like, &ldquo;Oh, yeah. Well, this person who wrote this is saying this, but what they didn&rsquo;t think about is XYZ.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t want that to happen.
</p>

<p>
You can say, &ldquo;Hey, I know what you&rsquo;re thinking. You&rsquo;re probably thinking XYZ. Actually, that doesn&rsquo;t apply. Here&rsquo;s why.&rdquo; Right? Anticipate those objections.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stay non-partisan, not just presenting new data, I&rsquo;m shifting the mental frame. Reframe public housing as human security, essential to stability, safety in the social contract, moral clarity and so on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Policy makers are humans too. Values move them, especially when those values are tied to national identity or fairness, political and economic feasibility. It&rsquo;s not just pie in the sky, like I&rsquo;m a hippie and like, I think we should all just be happy and love each other. No, this is actually plausible. This could happen. Here&rsquo;s the specifics of the plan that&rsquo;s actually achievable and strategic urgency. Action only happens when the status quo feels untenable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the cost of inaction? Why is this so important? What&rsquo;s what will happen if we don&rsquo;t do this? What&rsquo;s the cost?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
So this is helping me think about what&rsquo;s going to make it good.
</p>

<p>
I would find that very helpful as a starting point in writing, and that&rsquo;s a, hopefully a different approach than just getting it to write for you, which maybe is what it&rsquo;s sort of would do by default.

<p>
That&rsquo;s super helpful. And I think some of our concerns are the kind of obvious counter arguments to our reallocations in terms of credibility, feasibility&#x2026; So I think that gives us some great suggestions for how to make prompts around like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m concerned that this is going to seem pie in the sky or not credible or doable, can you identify those arguments so I can address them.&rdquo;
