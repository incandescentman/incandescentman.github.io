* ChatGPT Use Cases for Mamie

** Thinking of an idea

** Developing an idea for a screenplay
I was asked to give a talk for Machine Cinema's Gen-Dojo, a group of filmmakers interested in AI. Here's an AI recap of my talk.

Using AI as a Creative Partner --- Not a Replacement

Speaker: Sunjay Dixit, for Machine Cinema's Gen-Dojo

**** Core Idea:
Don't use AI to generate your creative work. Use it to draw it out of you.

"Instead of asking AI to be creative, ask it to help you be creative."

**** ðŸ”„ The Reframe: Socratic AI

I shared a framework I call Socratic AI---a way to use tools like ChatGPT or Claude as a thinking partner, not a prose generator.

Rather than asking:

- "Write my essay"
or
- "Suggest a thesis for this assignment"

Try this:

- "Ask me tough questions to help me clarify my own thesis."

**** ðŸ’¡ Why It Works for Writers

We became writers because we have something to say. We have stories, ideas, humor, insights---a voice. An LLM doesn't know what's in your head. But it can help you get it out.

Writing is hard. First drafts rarely capture the personality or insight we imagined. That's where AI can help---not by doing the work for you, but by prompting you, pushing you, sparring with you. Like a writing partner in a room who asks, "Yeah, but why does she do that?" or "What's the emotional truth here?"

**** ðŸ›  Real Example: Rewriting a Mafia Classic

I shared a screenplay idea I've been developing---a mafia story told from the POV of the mob wife, who turns out to be the true mastermind behind her husband's rise.

Instead of asking AI to write it, I used it to talk it out. I fed it the premise and asked it to ask me follow-up questions. That's when things came alive. The questions---What's her background? How does she learn the rules? What's driving her?---helped me refine my own thinking and deepen the story.

"I don't find it hard to talk to ChatGPT. I find it hard to stare at a legal pad and force myself to write 'FADE IN.' But if I say, 'Here's my idea,' and it says, 'Interesting. What happens next?'---I'm off and running."

**** ðŸ§  The Underlying Principle

We think of AI as something we prompt---but what if we let it prompt us?

"Instead of seeing the AI as a question-answering machine, treat it like an interviewer, a writing coach, a curious collaborator."

That switch---from answerer to asker---has been transformational for me. It's not about outsourcing the work. It's about sparking creativity, sharpening ideas, and making the work more joyful.

** Writing a policy brief
I spoke to a group of students at Simon Fraser University. They asked about how to use ChatGPT to support them in writing policy briefs without having it generate the article for them.


*** Megan MacKenzie
That's really helpful.

Sunjay, I have a question that kind of links this. A lot of the writing we're doing is not creative. It's not really fulfilling our own goals.

It's for a professor, or it's for... So, we're writing policy briefs in this context. And I wonder if you can give us some ideas of the prompts we could generate to think about how to improve the writing for the audience.

We're thinking about the difference with the creative writing process and how you get feedback.

But what happens when you're writing not in a creative context? When you're writing with stricter boundaries, what are the kinds of prompts you might use with ChatGPT with that kind of writing?

Because we're trying to foster our own voice. But most of the students here don't get to write in their own voice very often, unless it's for their personal use.

*** Sunjay Dixit
Give me an example of a writing assignment and what it might be that's the kind of non-creative writing assignment that you might have.

*** Megan MacKenzie
So yeah, so the assignment that we're working on now is really to create a policy brief. To try and convince a public audience first of all â€” but also try and convince a certain policy maker â€” everyone has a different audience â€” of how and why to reallocate a particular form of militarized spending.

So whether it's F-35s, or money spent on the carceral system â€” and reallocate that to the issue they've been focusing on.

So whether that's more nurses, or support for those with opioid addictions..

So everyone has a different issue they've been focusing on. Human security and enhanced human security, and we're thinking of ways to reallocate militarized spending.

So they're writing a policy brief, and then we're going to write a social media post that's a little bit more concise, because in the end, we're trying to both influence policymakers, but also reach a public audience to say, "hey you can Think about military spending differently."

*** Megan MacKenzie
Oh, you're going to help us in real time!!



*** Sunjay Dixit
Yeah, exactly.

I might start by sitting stating my goal like that, right, and see what it says. it's so already, it's giving me an outline for balancing credibility and clarity with moral force and emotional resonance.

So this is what I would call, it's helping me clarify my goals.

It's saying, "OK, great. You want to convince them. One. Maybe you can do it by doing this I outlined for in spending on military, yeah, and it's giving me an outline that I can use for the thing itself."

*** Sunjay Dixit
So at this point I might say like, "no, no stop. Do not write the opening paragraph. Please do not do any writing for me. I want all the ideas and the writing to come from me instead. Help me clarify I what the piece? What attributes the piece would need to have in order to can convince policy."

*** Sunjay Dixit
So you can see, the default thing that ChatGPT might want to do is to jump in and do it for you. I have to clarify and tell it "Don't do that, here's what I want instead."

*** Sunjay Dixit
OK, maybe this is helpful... "to influence policymakers and engage the public, your piece should have five core attributes, credibility. Need to trust your facts, anticipate counter arguments and feel that you're serious. So by citing authoritative sources using precise numbers and comparisons, preempting objections."

So, that's a good one. You never want the reader to feel like they're smarter than you, and to read something that you wrote and be like, "Oh, yeah. Well, this person who wrote this is saying this, but what they didn't think about is XYZ." You don't want that to happen.

You can say, "Hey, I know what you're thinking. You're probably thinking XYZ. Actually, that doesn't apply. Here's why." Right? Anticipate those objections.

"Stay non-partisan, not just presenting new data, I'm shifting the mental frame. Reframe public housing as human security, essential to stability, safety in the social contract, moral clarity and so on."

"Policy makers are humans too. Values move them, especially when those values are tied to national identity or fairness, political and economic feasibility. It's not just pie in the sky, like I'm a hippie and like, I think we should all just be happy and love each other. No, this is actually plausible. This could happen. Here's the specifics of the plan that's actually achievable and strategic urgency. Action only happens when the status quo feels untenable."

"What is the cost of inaction? Why is this so important? What's what will happen if we don't do this? What's the cost?"

So this is helping me think about what's going to make it good.

I would find that very helpful as a starting point in writing, and that's a, hopefully a different approach than just getting it to write for you, which maybe is what it's sort of would do by default.

*** Megan MacKenzie
That's super helpful. And I think some of our concerns are the kind of obvious counter arguments to our reallocations in terms of credibility, feasibility... So I think that gives us some great suggestions for how to make prompts around like, "I'm concerned that this is going to seem pie in the sky or not credible or doable, can you identify those arguments so I can address them."

** Creating a WhatsApp group with my friends for morning accountability
Some friends and I decided to start meeting at my local coffee shop to co-work. I wanted to create a WhatsApp group to corral everyone.
