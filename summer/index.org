As someone who is having a birthday, one of the privileges that is afforded me is the right to force you to come celebrate with me at a time and place of my choosing. 



The house will serve a small menu of unusual cocktails of gin, mezcal, and moonshine, as well as light snacks. Your own civilian contributions of booze and foodstuffs are likewise welcome but certainly not required. Please feel free too to invite friends.

Looking forward to seeing you all.

Until then!

Jay
