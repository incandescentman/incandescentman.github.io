- Hey are you there? 
- Rachel is responding to a potential online date and we could use your wordsmithing 


haha sure

- Ok so we're answering the question "what are you up to this weekend" and my thinking is that she should emphasize that she's spending time with me (her best friend continuously for 25 years) and with her family
- You know, to emphasize that she can sustain lasting healthy relationships
- We're going to her sisters house later for tree decorating
- Ok, so how would you put all of that?

why don't you write a draft and I'll edit it 

- Boo 
- Ok hang on
- Here are our notes so far

- Pretty straightforward :)

boring. nothing to visualize. doesn't even answer the question of what she's doing!

- I'm not looking for a critique, weirdo
- :)

hanging ornaments on a plastic tree at my sister's house 

would be your starting point 

but say what you're actually doing for one thing 

use real details 

don't be vague 

- Are you giving me a writing lesson??

but what are you guys actually doing 

give me 5 things you actually did or are going to do 

- Eating pho, decorating tree, getting our nails done, watching Jane the Virgin, drinking White Russians, eating leftovers, gossiping about people we used to know 
- Playing Connect Four with nephews, instagramming everything

now we're talking!

so much fun detail there 

and where are you? Seattle?

- Yes!!

did you make the pho?

- Nah 

her sister's son? how old?

- Sister's sons who are 6 and 5

what's the gossip? anything mentionable?

- Um... mostly about people we went to high school with who are divorcing 
- Rachel says that if they get married you're invited to the wedding
- And now she's called you her Cyrano de Bergerac 

haha awesome 

"My best friend is visiting from NYC and we made White Russians. I told my 5yo nephew we were drinking milk, but I think he figured out we were drunk when we played Connect 4 and he beat us."

- You are a master weaver of stories

- Ok she's sending :)
- Thanks for your help! We really liked the way you wove those details together
- Your middle name should be "The Tapestry"

You're welcome!

How are you? I'm driving home to nyc while my family has thanksgiving dinner in Syracuse without me :-/

- Great! Rachel and I are having a wonderful time. I've been here since Monday and am staying until Wednesday 
- And you know what we've been up to bc I listed all those things before

haha so true 

still can't believe a five-year-old beat you at connect four 

Keep me posted if the Monsieur replies 

- Will do!
