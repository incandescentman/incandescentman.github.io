<li>Hey are you there?</li>
<li>Rachel is responding to a potential online date and we could use your wordsmithing</li>
</ul>


<p>
haha sure
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ok so we&rsquo;re answering the question &ldquo;what are you up to this weekend&rdquo; and my thinking is that she should emphasize that she&rsquo;s spending time with me (her best friend continuously for 25 years) and with her family</li>
<li>You know, to emphasize that she can sustain lasting healthy relationships</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re going to her sisters house later for tree decorating</li>
<li>Ok, so how would you put all of that?</li>
</ul>

<p>
why don&rsquo;t you write a draft and I&rsquo;ll edit it 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boo</li>
<li>Ok hang on</li>

<li>:)</li>
</ul>

<p>
hanging ornaments on a plastic tree at my sister&rsquo;s house 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
but say what you&rsquo;re actually doing for one thing 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
don&rsquo;t be vague 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Are you giving me a writing lesson??</li>
</ul>

<p>
but what are you guys actually doing 
</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eating pho, decorating tree, getting our nails done, watching Jane the Virgin, drinking White Russians, eating leftovers, gossiping about people we used to know</li>
<li>Playing Connect Four with nephews, instagramming everything</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p>

</p>

<p>

</ul>

<p>

</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Um&#x2026; mostly about people we went to high school with who are divorcing</li>
<li>Rachel says that if they get married you&rsquo;re invited to the wedding</li>
<li>And now she&rsquo;s called you her Cyrano de Bergerac</li>
</ul>

<p>
haha awesome 
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My best friend is visiting from NYC and we made White Russians. I told my 5yo nephew we were drinking milk, but I think he figured out we were drunk when we played Connect 4 and he beat us.&rdquo;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You are a master weaver of stories</li>

<li>Ok she&rsquo;s sending :)</li>
<li>Thanks for your help! We really liked the way you wove those details together</li>
<li>Your middle name should be &ldquo;The Tapestry&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>
You&rsquo;re welcome!
</p>

<p>
