* Sunjay's Birthday Soir√©e

[[file:img/2.png]]

guys this is a big one!

I just graduated with my MFA in writing... üéì \\
I just started a new job I've only told a few people about... ü¶æ \\
I'll be just back from two months of being mostly in SF... üåÅ \\
oh and did I mention it's my birthday? ü§Ø \\

so pls join me for a small bday bash to celebrate life and its events and my beloved humans who are in it with me at the beautiful indoor/outdoor space at my brother Neil's apartment in Dumbo.

Paul and Claire will be leading some fun party games / icebreaker questions / conversational storytelling activities. we will also serve unusual bespoke cocktails and maybe even food!

[[mailto:jay@jaydixit.com][RSVP]] so I can get a headcount. Your own civilian contributions of favorite snacks or exotic beverages from far-flung tropical/alpine/polar locales are likewise welcome!

until then! \\
